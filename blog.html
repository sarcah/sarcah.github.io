            <h3>The psychology of web design</h3>
            <p>One of my favourite things about websites is the user experience (UX). Trying to design a website that gets the information across to the user in the best way possible, and then convincing them to act a certain way (browsing the site, purchasing something, clicking on a link etc). So much of this is achieved by having insights into human behaviour, and the way we experience the online world. Looking at dwell times on pages, page visits, how people end up navigating to a particular page are all things that can help a designer improve their website.</p><br> 

            <p>A few years ago I went to a retail convention, and there was a professor from Harvard speaking. He was talking about a case study of a travel website. When the customers clicked ‘search’ it would take up to ten seconds for all the various flights from airlines to load. The company originally had nothing change in the website while it was searching, then moved to having an animated icon of a plane going back and forth, with some text saying ‘we’re working hard to find you the best deal’. This very small and very simple change significantly decreased drop off rates. Customers were much more inclined to wait for the results to load, and when surveyed, said they felt the website was ‘working hard’ to find the best deals for them. Obviously this is an example of users humanising a website – if they stopped to think about it, they would logically know it made no difference. But the stats show it definitely affected their subconscious and their overall feelings towards the website.</p><br> 
            
            <p>It’s also interesting to think about how space, colour and typography set the tone of a website. I could design websites with identical content, but vastly different designs, and users would interact with them differently. Designers also need to be aware what current trends are design overall, and in the area they are in specifically. Colour choice also matters. It’s generally thought that cooler colours (blue and greens) often provide an inviting, professional and relaxed feeling. In contrast, it can be used to give a very cold and unfriendly feeling as well. Warmer colours (yellows, oranges, reds) are soothing, warm, and give a sense of creativity but can also give off negative feelings such as anger and stress. Then there is also the need to make sure colours are complementary and work well together.</p><br>
            
            <p>Although there are UX professionals, I think it’s something that web designers also need to keep at top of mind. No point having the most beautiful elegantly written code in the world if the website is not being used in the way you wanted or intended it to be. A three page checkout on a retail site may be a feat of technical back end engineering, but that doesn’t count for much if very few customers actually complete their purchase.</p><br>

            <h3>Online vs instore retail</h3>
            <p>There has been much debate in recent years about the future of retail. We’ve often heard about the death of physical stores, and all retail will move to online. We’ve seen previously exclusively online retailers like Amazon launch physical stores (you can read more <a href=https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22534570/amazon-fresh-full-size-grocery-store-just-walk-out-cashierless-technology-bellevue-washington>here</a>). But is the death of physical stores? Do customers want to only shop online? </p><br>

            <p>Well… not really. According to the <a href="https://auspost.com.au/business/marketing-and-communications/access-data-and-insights/ecommerce-trends">Australia Post annual report</a>, 7.4+ million households have shopped online between 1 January and 30 April 2021, up 5.5% YOY. Online share of retail spend hit 16.3% (excluding cafes, restaurants and takeaway food), outperforming the pre-pandemic predictions of 12-13%. There is obviously some very impressive growth there, and much more to come. It’s important to note that Australia also lags behind the rest of the world when it comes to online shopping, other countries have a much higher share of online vs instore purchases. </p><br>

            <p>The pandemic has certainly changed people’s retail habits, particularly in Victoria who endured the longest lock down of all the states. People who had previously never bought something online were forced to, and presumably at least some of them will keep this new habit up. But there is also evidence to support that customers do like instore shopping. They may want the item immediately, they may want to see the look, feel or size of the item, they may want to purchase multiple items at once from a shopping centre. Often, they may want to compare prices online, but then make a purchase instore once they see the item. </p><br>

            <p>The future of retail, I believe, is a mix of the two, and is very dependent on the type of product being sold. Online only retailers are great, are able to quickly react, and have far few barriers to entry, leading to much innovation from new players. Omnichannel retailers need to have a robust online presence, and do their best to replicate a positive shopping experience. They must also make sure the stores are enjoyable to shop in, and provide an ‘experience’ to the customer (whole other blog post in that). There must be consistency across the two channels, particularly from a branding, product pricing and customer experience point of view. These are the retailers that will succeed in the future.</p><br>

            <h3>Why you SHOULD judge a book by it’s cover</h3>
            <p>I hate the phrase ‘don’t judge a book by it’s cover’. I worked in the book industry for many years, as a buyer. It was my job to evaluate books each month, and decide what titles we would take and how many. When I worked for a bookshop in the support office, I could see up to twenty publishers once a month, who would show my hundreds and hundreds of titles. There was a number of factors to decide which books to take – previous sales by the same author, the amount of marketing support the publisher was putting behind it, who the author was, who was publishing in it, previous sales by similar books, AND THE COVER (also actually the contents, but that’s probably further down the list than you think).</p><br>

            <p>Book covers are designed with quite a lot of thought in mind. The designer is briefed, they come up with a few different options, these are then discussed by the author and their agent, and the editorial, sales and marketing teams, and sometimes retail buyers. Many people put a lot of time and effort into picking a cover that is indicative of what type of book it is, and is commercial enough to sell. There are often trends in publishing, with many books looking quite comparable. If you read and liked ‘Girl on the Train’ you can pick up one of the many books with a very similar cover, and you are very likely to find a similar kind of story. Debut writers often get new and different looking covers, in an effort to break them into the market. Authors with many books will usually have a certain look to them (even if they’re not in a series), and bestselling authors get their book covers periodically refreshed in order to stay relevant and possibly prompt an uplift in sales.</p><br>
                
            <p>So. Next time you’re deciding what to read, feel free to judge the book by it’s cover, and to as if you even pick it up to read the blurb. Even once you read it, feel free to judge it by the cover as well as the contents – hopefully they match up. And appreciate covers for the works of art they (sometimes) are, a lot of work go into them!</p><br>
                
            <p>* I am of course only talking about the literal interpretation of this phrase. You should absolutely not judge people by what they look like!</p><br>
