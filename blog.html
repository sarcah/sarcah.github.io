            <h3>Why wine drinkers live longer</h3>
            <p>There have been many studies in recent years
            on whether wine drinkers live longer. The consensus 
            varies, but it is generally thought that noderate 
            drinking with the majority days of the week as alcohol 
            free is good for your health, and can lead to longer
            life spans. And no matter what, it probably makes life
            more fun, so let's raise a glass.</p>

            <h3>When we'll be able to travel again</h3>
            <p>Covid has drastically changed the way the world 
                looks at travel. Australia was lucky with the number
                of covid cases, and the fact that the borders were able
                to be shut relatively easily. However, what does that mean
                for international tourism? With no current word on when 
                the borders will open for recreational travel, we'll have 
                to stick to interstate travel, and getting to know our own
                home better. </p>

            <h3>What's the future of restaurants?</h3>
            <p>Many restaurants pivoted in the past year, and 
                moved to takeaway options. Either through a simple
                delivery system, or elaborate cook at home kits from
                fancier restaurants. As in person dining opens back up, 
                will these same restaurants continue? Hopefully they have
                found these new revenue streams profitable, and we can now
                dine on fancy food in the comfort of our own homes. </p>

            <h3>Why swimming is good for your mental health</h3>
            <p>Swimming has so many benefits - both physical and mental. Being 
                active has a positive impact on mental health including: improving 
                mood, increasing self-esteem, lowers the risk of depression, 
                slows dementia and cognitive decline, improves sleep and reduces stress. 
                Swimming in cold water particularly can act as a shock to the system
                and a number of people swim all year round to take advantage of this.

            <h3>The rise and rise of gin</h3>
            <p>The latest data from the 2018 International Wine and Spirit 
                Report shows Australia's gin consumption grew by almost 33 
                per cent from 2017 to 2018 and more than 15 per cent from 
                2013 to 2018. A lot of that rise is down to the ubiquity 
                and quality of Australia's craft gin. It dwarfs growth 
                among other types of alcohol. To say gin's popularity is 
                booming in Australia might be an understatement.  </p>
