                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I have a background in retail, primarily in category management and marketing. 
                    I always enjoyed these roles, particularly around the areas of buying behaviour, 
                    and trying to anticpate what customers wanted and needed. Combining buying and 
                    marketing meant I was able to look at the bigger picture, and utilise all possible 
                    avenues in order to achieve KPIs and goals. I have excellent interpersonal, 
                    influencing and communication and presentation skills, with an organised approach, 
                    with extensive experience in building internal and external relationships. 
                    I am results driven, with a passion for data analysis and research.</p>

                <p>I recently chose to broaden my experience by completing a Diploma in IT, so I 
                    would have the technical skills as well as marketing and UX to create meaningful 
                    and effective websites. I enjoy looking at web applications holistically, and 
                    making sure they offer the user the best experience possible. I love user 
                    stories and experience, documentation, solving pain points, market and customer 
                    analysis and delivering results!  I am now looking to utilise my previous experience 
                    and new skills to go into product ownership/management.</p><br><br>
