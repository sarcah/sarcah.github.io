### Purpose
The purpose of this website is to showcase my skills, projects, work and employment history and personal information to prospective employers. This ongoing work in progress allows me to have an online presence that can be continuously updated as I learn new skills, and will assist in gaining future employment. The website has been designed to be responsive, with ease of use in navigation and allows access for differently abled users.

#### Functionality and Features
**Drop down menu**
The drop down menu is consistently located on the top right corner of each page. The menu button shows a pointer hover, and changes colour when clicked. The dropdown components show a different hover colour (using opaque scale for ease of reading). The menu bar does not contain a link to the page being visited, so as not to be repetitious. 

**Home page buttons**
These aim to provide the user an extra incentive to click through to other pages, and make a feature of them on the homepage. These buttons also have a hover feature.

**Heading and Footers**
Heading appear consistent with font and styling on each page, with the home page being more stylised for name.
The footer bar is consistent on each page, with the homepage footer giving credit to image sources. 

**Resume Download**
The Resume page lists employment and education highlights, and ability to click on either the icon or the text to download a pdf of resume.

**Contact Links**
Links on the contact page link to Twitter, LinkedIn and Github pages. There is also a pop up link to an pre-filled email. The page also contains an mp4 logo to provide a dynamic element.

**Styling**
All pages use a consistent style, including components, colours and fonts. The Nuninto Sands font is used throughout. All colour choices are used from the colour palette from the logo.

**Subresource integrity**
This feature has been enabled to ensure the resources fetched are secure.
